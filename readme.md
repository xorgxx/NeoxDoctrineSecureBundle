# **Only Standalone mode !!**
# NeoxDoctrineSecureBundle { Symfony 6/7 } 
This bundle provides Encrypt/Decrypt data sensible in a Db system in your application.
Its main goal is to make it simple for you to manage encrypt & decrypt sensible data into Db!
This bundle is to refresh the old bundle [DoctrineEncryptBundle](https://github.com/absolute-quantum/DoctrineEncryptBundle)

The aim of this bundle is to establish, in an automatic and transparent manner, a robust encryption and decryption
system by externalizing data, in strict compliance with European recommendations and the directives of the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR).

````php

  use NeoxDoctrineSecure\NeoxDoctrineSecureBundle\Attribute\neoxEncryptor; 
  ....
  
  #[ORM\Column(type: Types::TEXT, nullable: true)]
  #[neoxEncryptor]
  private ?string $content = null;
  
  ....
````
## Important !
Consider the size / length of field you want to crypt !! ex: length:10 
````php

  #[neoxEncryptor]
  #[ORM\Column(length: 20)]
  private ?string $name = null;
  
  "john doe" <- decrypt / encrypt -> "MUIFAOpLp21iX1Dy2ZNkYbby6zo7ADYgVs-hGkNaWR2OF5AbQUMcBKZHigtFVxZiIFWyOTV8Ts-9q_pNAHBxCKcAPZNJjfPgVQglMLAKi0bZicmPlCQKJpRpX2k5IAjAqawOlFsPpD9KikIEFRhuy"
