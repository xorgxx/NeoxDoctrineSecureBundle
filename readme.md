# NeoxDoctrineSecureBundle { Symfony 6/7 }
This bundle provides Encrypt/Decrypt data sensible in a Db system in your application.
Its main goal is to make it simple for you to manage encrypt & decrypt sensible data into Db!
This bundle is to refresh the old bundle [DoctrineEncryptBundle](https://github.com/absolute-quantum/DoctrineEncryptBundle)

The aim of this bundle is to establish, in an automatic and transparent manner, a robust encryption and decryption
system by externalizing data, in strict compliance with European recommendations and the directives of the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR).

  composer require xorgxx/neox-doctrine-secure-bundle:0.*
````
ðŸš¨ You will heva to add in your projet ðŸš¨
````
  composer require paragonie/halite
````
.env file
````
  ....
  # standalone = "buit-in" only type string 255, text 
  # external   = this mode will externalize data in one entity (TODO : redis )
  NEOX_ENCRY_DSN=standalone://redis
  ....
````
neox_doctrine_secure.yaml file
````
  neox_doctrine_secure:
      neox_dsn: "%env(NEOX_ENCRY_DSN)%"
      neox_encryptor: haliteII  # halite or haliteII not yet implement
      neox_pws: [!!password!!]  # 16 bit
  
````
ðŸš¨ You will have to make migration to add NeoxEncryptor entity ðŸš¨
````
  symfony make:migration
  symfony doctrine:migrations:migrate
````
**We have only implemented Halite service to Crypt / unCrypt**

**NOTE:** _You may need to use [ symfony composer dump-autoload ] to reload autoloading_

 ..... Done ðŸŽˆ

## Usage !
In entity, you want to secure field (data) 
````php

  use NeoxDoctrineSecure\NeoxDoctrineSecureBundle\Attribute\neoxEncryptor; 
  ....
  
  #[ORM\Column(type: Types::TEXT, nullable: true)]
  #[neoxEncryptor]
  private ?string $content = null;

````
## Important !
Consider the size / length of field you want to crypt !! ex: length:10 
````php

  #[neoxEncryptor]
  #[ORM\Column(length: 20)]
  private ?string $name = null;
  
  "john doe" <- decrypt / encrypt -> "MUIFAOpLp21iX1Dy2ZNkYbby6zo7ADYgVs-hGkNaWR2OF5AbQUMcBKZHigtFVxZiIFWyOTV8Ts-9q_pNAHBxCKcAPZNJjfPgVQglMLAKi0bZicmPlCQKJpRpX2k5IAjAqawOlFsPpD9KikIEFRhuy"
