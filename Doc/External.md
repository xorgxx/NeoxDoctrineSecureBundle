**CUSTOMIZE** Algorithm record [ key => data ] :
We want to enhance security by complicating the algorithm that automatically associates the source entity with the
encrypted entity in my Symfony application. Currently, this logic is exposed in the source code, which could pose a
security risk if the code is accessible to third parties. To make this association less obvious to a hacker, I would
like to make the algorithm more complex while also providing an easy customization option for users. Thus, even if the
source code is accessible, it would be challenging to easily determine which elements belong to which entities.
